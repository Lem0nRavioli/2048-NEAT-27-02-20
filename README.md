Python 2048 with pygame &amp; neat module

- Current issue is with the single-board deleting code, when i compare the state of the board before & after a move is called
- Might have to move the big-board declaration inside the eval_genome def after resolution of the bug above, never completed a whole run yet
- completly new to github, and not a veteran coder either, sorry for the very probable rookie mistakes that i've made in this project.
